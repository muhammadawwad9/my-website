                years old from Israel,Tamra , I'm a highly motivated developer
                and fast learner. I finished an intensive 16-weeks Full Stack
                Bootcamp at
                <i> Founders and Coders</i> in Haifa, Israel. Currently I'm
                seeking to launch a career in web development. I'm always
                striving to learn new technologies and to build interesting
                projects. I can work independently and also with a team. Coding
                makes me feel great, I really love what I do, and I
                enjoy/embrace each new project I become a part of.

                Aside from coding and developing, I am a basketball player.
                Basketball is an important part of my life, I grew up playing
                for different teams, and nowdays I play with my friends in my
                free time. Playing basketball makes me feel amazing and full of
                positive energy, also helps me to get back to work with a clear
                mind and get things done in a more efficient way.
